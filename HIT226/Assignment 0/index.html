            <h2>What are UX Roles?</h2>
            <p>
               UX roles describe the various parts designers play in the design process.<br>
               They range from generalist roles—e.g., UX designers and product designers—to specialist ones such as visual designers and UX researchers. <br>
               UX roles might overlap in scope, and they keep evolving with our understanding of the ideal design process.

<h2>UX Roles Serve the Design Process</h2> 
<p>One major part of what a design team does is to follow a user centered design process and work through it to produce the best possible designs for the target users. <br>
    Team-mates perform many tasks throughout projects—from user research[TTV3] , to prototyping, to conducting usability testing—to iterate towards optimal solutions. <br>
    Design thinking showcases the key UX tasks corresponding to these roles. It also reflects how each role contributes slightly differently regarding tasks. <br>
    Main roles are: <br>

<h3>Organizations’ definitions of UX roles vary. 
    While these shouldn’t deviate drastically from those listed above, you should research a brand’s culture to understand its expectations. <br>
    For instance, recruiters scanning UX portfolios may want a “UX designer” to handle all UX-related tasks. <br>
    Applicants would then address that in their UX cover letters and UX resumes. <br>
    Also, with the industry’s dynamic nature, expect to constantly find new job titles, job descriptions and UX tools. <br>
    Nonetheless, your knowledge remains timeless – you just must adapt to whatever hat your company wants you to wear. <br>
